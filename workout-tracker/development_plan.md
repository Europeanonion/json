# Workout Tracker Development Plan

## Goal: Prepare the Workout Tracker for Launch

This plan outlines the steps to prepare the `workout-tracker` application for launch, including feature enhancements, improvements, and deployment strategies.

## Phase 1: Feature Enhancements

1.  **Implement Workout Creation and Editing:**
    *   Allow users to create new workouts.
    *   Implement a form for creating and editing workouts, including fields for workout name, phase, week, and exercise selection.
    *   Integrate the workout creation and editing functionality with the `WorkoutProvider` to manage workout data.
2.  **Implement Exercise Editing:**
    *   Allow users to edit existing exercises.
    *   Implement a form for editing exercises, pre-populated with the existing exercise data.
    *   Integrate the exercise editing functionality with the `ExerciseProvider` to manage exercise data.
3.  **Implement Exercise Deletion:**
    *   Allow users to delete exercises.
    *   Implement a delete confirmation dialog to prevent accidental deletions.
    *   Integrate the exercise deletion functionality with the `ExerciseProvider` to manage exercise data.
4.  **Implement Workout Scheduling:**
    *   Allow users to schedule workouts for specific days or weeks.
    *   Implement a calendar or scheduling interface to visualize and manage workout schedules.
    *   Integrate the scheduling functionality with the `WorkoutProvider` to manage workout data.

## Phase 2: Improvements and Refactoring

1.  **Improve UI/UX:**
    *   Refine the user interface for better usability and aesthetics.
    *   Implement responsive design to ensure the application works well on different screen sizes.
    *   Add visual feedback for user actions (e.g., loading indicators, success messages).
2.  **Enhance Error Handling:**
    *   Implement more robust error handling throughout the application.
    *   Provide informative error messages to the user.
    *   Log errors to a service like Sentry for monitoring and debugging.
3.  **Optimize Performance:**
    *   Optimize the application's performance to ensure fast loading times and smooth interactions.
    *   Implement code splitting to reduce the initial bundle size.
    *   Use memoization techniques to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
4.  **Improve Accessibility:**
    *   Ensure the application is accessible to users with disabilities.
    *   Use semantic HTML elements.
    *   Provide alternative text for images.
    *   Ensure sufficient color contrast.
    *   Provide keyboard navigation.
5.  **Refactor Code:**
    *   Refactor the codebase to improve readability, maintainability, and testability.
    *   Apply consistent coding style and conventions.
    *   Break down large components into smaller, more manageable ones.
    *   Write clear and concise comments.

## Phase 3: Deployment and Launch

1.  **Choose a Deployment Platform:**
    *   Select a suitable platform for deploying the application (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, AWS Amplify).
    *   Consider factors such as cost, ease of use, and scalability.
2.  **Configure Deployment:**
    *   Configure the deployment platform to build and deploy the application automatically.
    *   Set up environment variables for sensitive information (e.g., API keys).
3.  **Implement Analytics:**
    *   Integrate an analytics service (e.g., Google Analytics) to track user behavior and application usage.
4.  **Test Thoroughly:**
    *   Thoroughly test the application on different devices and browsers.
    *   Perform user acceptance testing (UAT) to gather feedback from real users.
5.  **Prepare for Launch:**
    *   Create a launch checklist to ensure all necessary steps are completed.
    *   Write release notes to inform users about new features and improvements.
6.  **Launch the Application:**
    *   Deploy the application to the chosen platform.
    *   Announce the launch to users.
    *   Monitor the application for any issues.

## Assumptions and Uncertainties:

*   **Data Persistence:** The current implementation uses local storage. For a production application, a more robust data persistence solution (e.g., a database) will be required.
*   **API Integration:** The application may require integration with external APIs for features such as exercise data or workout tracking.
*   **User Authentication:** User authentication is not currently implemented. This will be required for features such as user accounts and data synchronization.
*   **Backend:** A backend server may be required to handle data persistence, API integrations, and user authentication.

## Next Steps:

I will start by implementing the workout creation and editing features. This will involve modifying the `WorkoutProvider`, `WorkoutList`, and potentially creating new components for the workout form.
